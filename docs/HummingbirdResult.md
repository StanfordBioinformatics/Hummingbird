## Section 5: Hummingbird Result

For each stage of the pipeline, Hummingbird will print 3 different configurations on the terminal: the fastest, the cheapest, and the most efficient. The definition of each of these terms describing instance configurations are as follows:

1. The fastest: This configuration indicates the fastest instance/machine type amongst all the different configurations on which the pertaining stage of the pipeline was executed by Hummingbird. Here, fastest refers to the instance configuration with the least execution time.

2. The cheapest: The instance which costs the least is chosen by Hummingbird as the instance with the cheapest configuration.

3. The most efficient: The instance which has the most cost-efficient value, maximizing the computing power of a unit of spending.
